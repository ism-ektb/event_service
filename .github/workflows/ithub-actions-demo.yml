At this stage you don't need to understand the details of this workflow. For now, you can just copy and paste the contents into the file. After completing this quickstart guide, you can learn about the syntax of workflow files in "About workflows," and for an explanation of GitHub Actions contexts, such as ${{ github.actor }} and ${{ github.event_name }}, see "Accessing contextual information about workflow runs."
